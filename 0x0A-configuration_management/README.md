### Note on Versioning
My Ubuntu 14.04 VM have Puppet 3.4 preinstalled.
<br><br>
No need to attempt to upgrade versions. This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize with the basic level syntax which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet. 
<br><br>
The linked documentation is to Puppet 3.8 because the 3.4 documentation has been archived and is therefore more challenging to navigate. If you would like to upgrade anyway, [click here](https://joachim8675309.medium.com/installing-puppet-5-427ca7a68f02).<br>
